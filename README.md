#  Mastodon Glitch, Urusai+Sakurajima Edition

This is the repo for the fork of Mastodon used by [Sakurajima](https://sakurajima.moe) which is a fork of[Urusai! Social](https://urusai.social/). This repo exists so I don't have to copy and paste the customizations when I update Mastodon.

# Added features from [Urusai fork](https://github.com/neatchee/mastodon):

- Flavours/styles from @chikorita157@sakurajima.moe
- Emoji enhancements
  - Enlarge emoji in post content on mouse-over/tap
- Collapsed post improvements
  - show > 1 line for better visual parsing
  - customize height of posts to trigger lengthy toot collapse, etc)
- Option to merge boosts and favorites into a single notification for the same status
- Emoji reactions!
- Other minor fixes/improvements

So here's the deal: we all work on this code, and anyone who uses that does so absolutely at their own risk. can you dig it?
